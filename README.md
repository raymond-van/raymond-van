### Hey, I'm Ray!
I'm currently a software developer at Teranet Inc., working on [SEDAR+](https://www.sedarplus.ca/landingpage/), a Spring app that provides financial infrastructure for Canada.

I'm deeply fascinated about technology and how it can be used to positively impact our lives. I love to keep up with the latest advancements in machine learning research 🤖.

Outside of tech, you might catch me hitting the gym for a workout session 🏋️, diving into a captivating book 📚, or unwinding with a good TV show or movie 📺.
